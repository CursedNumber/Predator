These are the features actively planned for Predator and are likely to be added within the near future.

- [X] The ability to view plate data in different formats.

These are features that require much more in-depth changes, and are purely hypothetical.

- [ ] The ability to correlate license plate detects with GPS data from a GPX file.
- [ ] De-duplication of license plates that aren't identical, but are very similar and likely to be invalid repeats of the same plate.
- [ ] Support for real-time license plate reading through a Raspberry Pi or similar device.
- [ ] Real-time alerts for detected license plates.
    - [ ] AMBER Alert scanning
    - [ ] Stolen vehicle scanning
