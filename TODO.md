# Hypothetical

These are features that require more in-depth changes, and are purely hypothetical.

- [ ] The ability to process multiple sequential videos at once.
- [ ] De-duplication of license plates that aren't identical, but are very similar and likely to be invalid repeats of the same plate.
- [ ] The ability to black out parts of frames in real-time and pre-recorded mode to further refine where Predator will scan for license plates.
