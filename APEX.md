# Apex

This document briefly explains Predator Apex, the pre-built hardware program for Predator LPRS.


## Disclaimer

Predator Apex is by no means a mass produced product, and is not intended to be a consumer device. Each Predator Apex model is hand assembled with extremely limited resources. Think of Predator Apex as a quick and easy way to get started with the Predator system, not as a commercial product. Predator Apex is great for tinkerers and tech enthusiasts, not for people who want a simple, plug-and-play experience.


## Description

Predator is a powerful, multipurpose system capable of scanning license plates in pre-recorded video, analyzing real-time video streams, and running as a fully-featured dash-cam. While this versatility provides huge amounts of customization for technical users and hobbyists, the majority of users probably want a pre-configured setup as a starting point. That's where Predator Apex is useful.

Predator Apex is a collection of prebuilt hardware devices that come preconfigured with the Predator software. All Predator Apex devices use basic off-the-shelf parts, and are designed to be repairable, modifiable, and customizable, just like the Predator software itself.


## Documentation

While much simpler than building a Predator device from scratch, there are still some technical aspects to getting prebuilt Predator Apex device up and running. In it's current state, Predator runs via command line, and therefore needs to be controlled via SSH or other shell. For this reason, each Predator device has documentation explaining how to use it from start to finish to help less technical users get up and running.
