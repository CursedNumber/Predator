# Ethics

As with all V0LT projects, ethics is a core element of Predator's development. This document explains a lot of the ethical points that Predator adheres to.


## Transparency

As you likely already know, Predator (and all of its dependencies) are completely open source and freely auditable. When it comes to Predator, anyone is free to inspect the code the powers it in order to verify V0LT's claims.


## ALPR

The practice of automated license plate recognition (ALPR) is a very delicate subject. On one hand, ALPR can help find dangerous criminals and kidnapped children. However, over 99% of the license plates recorded by public ALPR systems are used to track the locations of innocent people.

### Alerts

Predator provides the ability to alert the user when it detects a license plate in an alert hotlist. These alerts can be used by users to receive alerts when they pass family members on the road, drive by a famous car, or any other situation they can think of. However, this feature can also be used in more serious situations, like AMBER alert plate detection.

For sake of conveinence and unity, Predator provides network based license plate alert hotlists to aid users who want to help their communities catch dangerous ctiminals. That being said, V0LT has extremely strict policies on what license plates are posted to this list.

Alerts may be published for the following situations.

1. A vehicle was recently stolen.
2. A violent criminal was last seen in a particular vehicle.
3. An AMBER alert published by law enforcement contained a license plate.

Alerts will not be published for the following situations. 

1. Vehicles involved in non-violent crimes.
2. Vehicles that witnessed a crime.
