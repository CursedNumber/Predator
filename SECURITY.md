# Security

## Disclaimer

While Predator strives to be reliable and secure, you should not rely on it for safety critical tasks. Predator is designed to be an accessible hobbyist-level alternative to industrial license plate reading devices, and shouldn't be used to authenticate vehicles at entry points, or detect criminal activity.


## Supported Versions

Due to Predator's update cycle, only the latest version receives security patches. However, in severe cases, patches for older version might be released on a case by case basis. Regardless, for the safest experience, you should always use the latest version of Predator.


## Reporting A Vulnerability
